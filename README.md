# 🎓 Arab Tutor - AI Video Dubbing & Summarization

This graduation project, **Arab Tutor**, is designed to help Arabic-speaking students understand English educational content more easily by automatically dubbing English videos into Arabic and summarizing their content.

By using advanced AI techniques, the project transforms English videos into:

* 🎧 **Arabic-dubbed versions** with synchronized lip movements
* 🧠 **Arabic summaries** of the content to aid understanding and studying

Ideal for students who face language barriers when studying international material like MOOCs, academic lectures, and tutorials.
